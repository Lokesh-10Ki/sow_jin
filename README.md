This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

JNext is a NextJS template which focused on **simplicity**, **modularity**, and **full-stack typesafety**. It consists of:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/)

### tRPC

tRPC is a tool that provides type-safety between your front and back-ends, hence it makes it really easy to build scalable and robust backends quickly for your Next.js and Node apps.

### Prisma

Prisma is an open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for Node.js and TypeScript that provides a powerful and type-safe interface for working with databases. It simplifies the process of interacting with databases by providing a high-level abstraction over SQL and other database query languages. Prisma is known for its developer-friendly features, such as auto-completion, type safety, and a query engine that optimizes performance.

[Know more about Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/introduction/what-is-prisma)

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev

npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Run the application


```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
